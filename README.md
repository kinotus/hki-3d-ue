# Helsinki 3D city model for Unreal Engine

A rudimentary Unreal Engine 5 template project containing Helsinki 3D city model data as 3DTiles used through Cesium for Unreal Engine plugin.

## What to expect from latest version (and what not to)
- Template is useable for browsing around the Helsinki in 3D, origin and georeferencing is "about there"
- Use for any real projects with your own risk.
- CesiumSunSky settings are yet to be refined.

## Versions

- Only UnrealEngine 5.21 for now
- Cesium for Unreal 5.2.0


## Data licenses

Helsinki datasets are by the city of Helsinki survey department and available as CC BY 4.0. See https://kartta.hel.fi/paikkatietohakemisto/pth/?id=306 and https://hel.fi/3d
